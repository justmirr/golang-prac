# golang-prac

This repository contains my personal journey learning the Go programming language from scratch — including example programs, notes, and mini-projects as I explore Go's capabilities.

## About

This repository is a learning log where I'll:

- Practice Go fundamentals
- Explore packages and modules
- Build small programs and utilities
- Document what I learn along the way

I’ll be gradually covering topics like:

- Variables, Types, and Functions
- Control Structures (if, for, switch)
- Structs and Interfaces
- Go Modules and Packages
- Concurrency (goroutines and channels)
- Error Handling
- File I/O and Networking
- Web development and APIs (coming soon)
